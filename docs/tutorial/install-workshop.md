# Installing the DCCM Core via Steam Workshop

This tutorial will guide you through installing the Dead Cells Core Modding (DCCM) core.

:::tip

For **Linux**, enabling **Proton** for **Dead Cells** is required. Please refer to [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561).

:::

## Installation

### Get SteamStartShell

Obtain **SteamStartShell** from [Github](https://github.com/dead-cells-core-modding/core/releases/download/v35.8.4/deadcells.exe)

### Overwrite

1. Locate the game's root directory.
2. Replace `deadcells.exe` in the game root directory with **SteamStartShell** (`deadcells.exe`).

### Launch

Launch the game via **Steam**. You should see output similar to:

```txt
[12:27:23 WRN] DCCM is not installed.
[12:27:23 INF] DCCM is downloading...
```

The **DCCM Core** will download from **Steam Workshop**. Please wait patiently.

:::tip
If this process takes too long, verify your network connection and try restarting **Steam**.
:::

The game will launch once the download completes.

### Installing Mods

Unlike [manual installation](./install-core.md), **installing the DCCM core via Steam Workshop** grants access to mods published on **Steam Workshop**.

Details on subscribing to **mods** in **Steam Workshop** are beyond the scope of this guide.

- Most **DCCM Mods** in the **Steam Workshop** have names starting with **[DCCM]**.
